                <h1>FRAUD AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUDITOR AND REPORTING OF FRAUD</h1>

                <p>
                    In fraud, financial statement fraud is one of the biggest types of fraud in today’s world. The complexity and mechanism of financial statement fraud brought the attention of the auditors. Financial scandals of Enron, WorldCom, Xerox, Tyco, Satyam computers increased auditor’s responsibility in detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions.<br />
                    Corporate fraud had negative consequences for the market capitalisation due to losses of investors and also, reputation and public trust on auditors are ruined. Investors and public expect auditors detecting fraud to protect third parties interests. The auditor’s core responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on financial statements whether they are free from material misstatement due to error and fraud and thereby enabling the auditor to express opinion on financial statement.<br />
                    The auditor’s responsibility for the detection of fraud is an ongoing issue that is surrounded by much controversy. It is believed by many people that auditors are responsible to detect fraud, while in fact they have a very limited role in detection of fraud. The public’s misconception of the auditor’s role and what the auditor role actually is, is referred to as the expectation Gap.<br />
                    In the auditing profession auditors have to keep up to date with standards on auditing, rules and laws. The main focus here is SA 240. This is the standard that covers fraud, and plays a large part in the way to detect fraud.

                <h2><u>SA -240 “The Auditor’s Responsibility Relating to Fraud in an Audit of Financial Statement”</u></h2>

                <p>
                    FRAUD: The term fraud means
                    An intentional act by one or more individuals among management, those charged with governance, employees and third parties involving the use of deception to obtain an unjust or illegal advantage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u>There are certain conditions in which fraud can occur:</u><br />
                    <li><b>Incentive or pressure to commit fraud: </b>It may exist when management is under pressure, from sources outside or inside the entity, to achieve an expected earnings target or financial outcome.</li>
                    <li><b>A Perceived opportunity to do so: </b> It may exist when an Individual believes internal control can be over-ridden
                        For example: because the individual is in position of trust or has knowledge of specific weakness in internal control.</li>
                    <li><b>Rationalisation of the act: </b>Individual may be able to rationalise committing fraudulent act. Some individual possess an attitude, character or set of ethical values that allow them knowingly and intentionally to commit a dishonest act. However, even otherwise honest individual commit fraud in an environment that imposes sufficient pressure on them.
                        For example: crossing of traffic signals though you know it is unlawful and rationalising the same on the grounds of emergency</li><br />
                    The primary responsibility of detection of fraud lies with those charged with governance of the entity and management. It is important that management place a strong emphasis on fraud prevention, detection of Fraud/Error. The primary objective of the auditor is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with SA, rules and regulations but not to prevent fraud.<br />
                    Furthermore, owing to the inherent limitation of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that some material misstatement will not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with SA’s
                </p>

                <h2><u>Reporting of Fraud</u></h2>

                <p>
                    If an auditors of the company has reasons to believe that an offence of fraud, which involves or is expected to involve individually an amount of rupees one crore or above, is being or has been committed against the company by its officers or employees, the auditor shall report the matter to the Central Government.<br />
                    <u>Auditor shall report the matter to Central Government as under:</u><br />
                    <li>Auditor shall report the matter to Board or Audit committee within 2 days of his knowledge of fraud and seeking their reply or observation within 45 days</li>
                    <li>On receipt of such reply or observation, the auditor shall forward his report and the reply or observations of the Board or the Audit Committee along with his comments the Central Government within 15 days from the date of receipt of such reply or observations;</li>
                    <li>n case the auditor fails to get any reply or observations from the Board or the Audit Committee within the stipulated period of 45 days, he shall forward his report to the Central Government along with a note containing the details of his report that was earlier forwarded to the Board or the Audit Committee.</li>

                    <li>The report shall be on the letterhead of the auditor containing postal address, email address and contact telephone number or mobile number and be signed by the auditor with his seal and shall indicate his Membership Number</li>
                    <li>The report shall be in the form of a statement as specified in Form ADT4</li>
                </p>

                <h2><u>Conclusion:</u></h2>

                <p>
                    Auditor is a watch dog but not blood hound. The SA 240 seeks to add clarity and enhance the overall responsibility of the auditor to further bridge the expectation gap between the general public’s expectations and the actual obligations. The responsibility of detection and prevention of fraud remains firmly with those charged with governance and the management by placing strong emphasis on fraud prevention and detection.
