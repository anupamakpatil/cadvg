                <h1>THE INDIAN CONTRACT ACT, 1872</h1>

                <p>
                    Contract may seem like an intimidating word to many, who picture in mind, complex formal agreements executed by big companies when they hear it. However, contracts have been existing since the ancient of times through trade and barter systems. They form an integral part of a common man's day-to-day activities. We enter into contracts every day, knowingly or unknowingly when we buy tickets to the movies or groceries from the mart.<br />
                    The Indian Contract Act, 1872 was enacted on 25th April, 1872 and subsequently came into force on the first day of September 1872.
                    Before the act was enacted, the contractual relationship was governed by the personal laws of different religious communities. Now, to understand the contract act in its present form we have to analyse the historical evolution of contract law taking into account the practices that were prevalent before the enactment came.<br /><br />
                    During the entire ancient and medieval periods of human history in India, there was no general code covering contracts. Principles were thus derived from numerous references. The evolution of contract started from Vedic and Medieval period to Roman period passing on to Islamic period, Hindu period and at the last British period. <br />
                    In all the period, contract means an agreement enforceable by law.In simple words, Contract = Agreement + Enforceability
                    Contracts are nothing but agreements between parties in which one party gets a benefit and the other party receives consideration for it. They can be oral, written or implied. Parties entering into a contract may include common people, companies, non-profit or government agencies.<br />

                <h2><u>Essential elements of a contract:</u></h2>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Offer and Acceptance:</b><br />
                    A Contract always involves two or more parties where one proposes and other accepts.
                    The first step towards formation of a contract is offer - it is when someone offers to do or not to do something. An offer should be definite, clear and not ambiguous. It should be communicated duly to the other party. It should be lawful.
                    The second step is acceptance of that offer. When that person to whom the proposal was communicated to gives approval, it is said to have accepted the proposal. Just like an offer, an acceptance of an offer should also be definite and clear, not ambiguous and should be duly communicated to the proposer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>2. Lawful Consideration</b><br />
                    Consideration is something to be given in return of a promise. The legal maxim, "quid pro quo" i.e., something for something explains it. When at the will of promisor, the promisee does or refrains from doing something, in present or in future, he gives consideration for that proposal. Agreements with unlawful considerations or no considerations are void. Hence there can be no contract without consideration.
                    Agreement = Promise + Consideration
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>3. Intention of Giving Rise to Legal Obligations</b><br />
                    An Agreement has all characters of a valid contract except for one thing - A legal obligation or enforcement. Section 2 (h) of India Contract Act states that- Agreements enforceable by law are contracts.

                    Contracts = Agreement + Legal Obligation
                    Hence, agreement becomes a wider term than contract giving rise to a popular saying that "All Contracts are agreements but not all agreements are Contracts".
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>4. Capacity</b><br />
                    The laws do not prohibit people from contracting. However, they declare certain classes of persons as incapable of entering into contracts. Hence, it is important for people to know if they are contracting with the right person or not, to avoid bad consequences. The Indian Contract Act of 1872 precisely mentions who are capable of entering into contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>5. Free Consent</b><br />
                    All Agreements are supposed to be bilateral which means both parties should gain something and both should be liable to each other. This forms one of the most important pillars of contract. Section 13 of the Contract Act defines consent which is the foremost requirement of a contract. It says that two or more people can be said to have consented for a thing if they agree upon the same thing in the same manner.
                    Section 14 of the Act lists down the vitiating elements in a contract. They are coercion, undue Influence, fraud, misrepresentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>6. Lawful Object</b><br />
                    What is enforced by law can never be unlawful. Since contracts are agreements which are enforced by law, the object creating contracts can never be unlawful/ illegal objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>7. Agreements Not Expressly Declared Void</b><br />
                    Agreements cannot be enforced if they are declared void from the very beginning. Wagering agreement is one where consideration is payable only after happening of a future, uncertain condition. These agreements are void contract.
                    Section 29 of the Act mentions that agreements which don't have any certainty or are not capable of being certain even in future, are void.
                </p>

                <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
                <p>
                    By analysing the development of the contract through different time periods, the applicability of the law may vary, but the underlying principle of all the laws remains the same, that minor cannot enter into contract, consent should be given by both the parties for the same manner and same sense and that certain person is disqualified from contracting.<br />
                    In everyday life, rural or urban, contracts are increasingly becoming common and important. Hence it is important not just for lawyers but even the general public to know the basic elements of a contractual agreement and their nature, in order to avoid financial losses or unprofitable deals.<br />
                    Even in our day to day life, we enter into numerous contracts like travelling through Public transport where we buy ticket for consideration (ticket price), paying electricity bill or buying a cup of coffee. While doing all these things, people usually donâ€™t realise that these are contracts as there will be no intention of giving rise to legal obligation. In this modern era of online shopping, people buy commodities and return them easily without any loss of money. This happens because of the agreement that they have entered into with those applications. From paying newspaper bills to obtaining multi million project in business, contract form the foundation for every transaction.
